# Docs Index

Project documentation lives under this `docs/` folder.

## Available Docs

- `architecture.md`: System architecture, layers, modules, and security model.
- `data-flow.md`: End-to-end data flow diagrams for auth, chat, CRUD, and admin operations.
- `api-docs.md`: API reference for all public routes in `app/api/*`.
- `user-guide.md`: End-user guide for login, character management, chat, settings, and admin usage.

## Retrieval Convention

- For architecture or integration questions, read `docs/` first.
- If code behavior differs from docs, treat code as source of truth and update docs in the same change.
